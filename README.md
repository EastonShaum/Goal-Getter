## Installation
This installation process is for locally hosted clones of Goal Getter:
1. Ensure that you are able to create a new SQL Database (we used Sequeylize and MySQL2) 
2. Clone repository 
3. Open a new command line that is in the correct directory 
4. Run `npm i `
5. Navigate to the ".env EXAMPLE" file 
6. Edit the DB_USER and DB_PW values to match your SQL Server credentials. 
7. Rename the ".env EXAMPLE" file to ".env"
8. Return to your open command line, load the schema.sql to create the appropriate database and tables.

## Usage 
First you need to [create an account](https://goal-getters-app.herokuapp.com/signup)! After you have created your account you can create new goals, add milestones (sub-goals that help move you towards completing your larger goal), and view your progress. Once a goal is created you can edit the information within it. To complete a goal you need to mark each of the milestones associated with the goal as complete! Upon doing so a "Complete Goal" button will appear at the top of the goal page. By clicking that button your goal will be marked as complete and you will be able to find it in the Achievements page, which displays every goal that you have accomplished!
